# SeanElliottPortfolio
This is my software portfolio project.

The navbar at the top of the webpage contains my name, avatar, short biography, work, and contact information.

Short biography, work, and contact information navbar links will direct users to corresponding sections on the webpage.

The work section contains screenshots of previous applications I've worked on. 

When the image of either of the applications is clicked, the user will be taken to the corresponding deployed application.

When the page is resized or viewed on different devices, the website's layout will adapt to the user's viewport. 

Link to deployed application: https://sean-elliott-97.github.io/SeanElliottPortfolio/
