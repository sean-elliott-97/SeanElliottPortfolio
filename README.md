## Description

-This is my software portfolio project.

-The navbar at the top of the webpage contains my name, avatar, short biography, work, and contact information.

-Short biography, work, and contact information navbar links will direct users to corresponding sections on the webpage.

-The work section contains screenshots of applications I've worked on. 

-When the image of any of the applications is clicked, the user will be taken to the corresponding deployed application.

-When the page is resized or viewed on different devices, the website's layout will adapt to the user's viewport.
